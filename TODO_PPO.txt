- 158-167 can we do that more elegant? through some wrapper function and functionals?
- multi environment learning (should be easy with the vecenv...)
- logging of: std, clip ratio, 

-- rest:
- use forced types in parameters dosmth(epsilon: float = 1e-4, ...)
- pull out all seeds to config such that it's possible to reproduce results exactly
- document optimizations ... (and give sources of each :))
- adjust name of tf run to contain important hyperparams!
- percent done + estimated time printen, rest Ã¼ber tensorboard...
- load/save model
- maybe separate debug log cfg?
- rewrite readme

- refine readme, add todolist there + whats done already.
- embed gifs of working agents + learning rates/adv/rewards per step/episode for different tasks
- order cfg...
- create a nice test file
