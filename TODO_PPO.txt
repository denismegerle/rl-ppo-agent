TODO:

-- general:
- optimizer cfg choosing
- define calculate gae properly, use two fcts or smth (for returns / advantages)
- remove TODO from calulate gae
- give _train the variables y_true_actions/returns + y_pred_vest_old IN their parameter
- 158-167 can we do that more elegant? through some wrapper function and functionals?
- rename ppo_entropy_factor to entropy_factor
- add 0.5 from gradient to cfg
- put distribution stuff in _util !
- is action rescaling actually implemented properly? since actions range != action_dist range...
- norm to logpdf maybe
- multi environment learning (should be easy with the vecenv...)
- rename cfg vars with naming scheme ( e.g. loss relevant stuff to loss_blablub, etc)
- make logging iffable
- make statefull/stateless std iffable


-- rest:
- costa.sh -> implementation details checken
- use forced types in parameters dosmth(epsilon: float = 1e-4, ...)
- proper naming for envs in tb!
- pull out all seeds to config such that it's possible to reproduce results exactly
- document optimizations ... (and give sources of each :))
- put all losses in the _utils...
- adjust name of tf run to contain important hyperparams!
- percent done + estimated time printen, rest Ã¼ber tensorboard...
- load/save model
- maybe separate debug log cfg?

temp:
- what to log: actorloss, criticloss,
